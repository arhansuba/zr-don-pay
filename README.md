# zr-don-paymaster


## Overview

**`zr-don-pay`** is a comprehensive solution that integrates a decentralized oracle with zkSync Paymaster, leveraging advanced cross-chain functionalities and secure transaction management. The project aims to enhance the efficiency and security of cross-chain transactions by combining the power of Eigenlayer decentralized oracle with zkSync’s Paymaster for gasless transactions.

## Vision

The goal of **`zr-don-pay`** is to create a robust and secure system for managing cross-chain transactions and decentralized data feeds. By integrating the decentralized oracle capabilities of Eigenlayer with zkSync’s Paymaster, the project provides a seamless and gas-efficient solution for handling transactions and data across multiple blockchains.

## BUIDL Description

**`zr-don-pay`** provides the following features:
- **Cross-Chain Token Transfers**: Securely lock and mint tokens across different blockchains using `ZrSignBridge`.
- **Decentralized Oracles**: Utilize Eigenlayer’s decentralized oracle for reliable and secure data feeds.
- **Gasless Transactions**: Leverage zkSync’s Paymaster to facilitate gasless transactions and optimize transaction costs.

### Architecture

- **TokenLocker**: Manages token locking on the source blockchain.
- **TokenMinter**: Handles token minting on the target blockchain.
- **ZrSignBridge**: Facilitates cross-chain transactions with secure signing.
- **zkSync Paymaster**: Enables gasless transactions by covering gas fees.
